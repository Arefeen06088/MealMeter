MealMeter is a machine learning-driven framework that uses multimodal sensor data from wearable and mobile devices to estimate meal macronutrient composition. Unlike traditional self-reported dietary assessments, which are time-consuming and prone to errors, MealMeter leverages physiological signals (e.g., glucose levels, heart rate variability) and motion data to predict carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake with high accuracy. Tested on data from 12 participants, it significantly outperforms baseline models and demonstrates the potential to automate meal tracking and enhance personalized nutrition strategies for metabolic health management.

The study involved 12 healthy adults in a controlled trial approved by associated IRB. Participants, free from metabolic or thyroid conditions, wore Dexcom G6 CGMs and Empatica E4 wristbands to monitor glucose, activity, and physiological signals across three 10-hour lab sessions. They consumed standardized meals (hypercaloric, eucaloric, or hypocaloric) aligned with dietary guidelines, with meal intake and activity closely monitored.
